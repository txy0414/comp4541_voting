## Testing
This link below is the contract I deployed. Due to the principle: only the owner of the contract can start the vote or interact most of the functions, it is essential for professor or TAs to deploy the contract on Remix for testing the functionality. 

Steps:
1. Copy the contract and deploy it on Remix
2. Copy the deployed contract address and replace the address in the html file (Search // Replace with your deployed contract address // in the file.)
3. Open the html file on Chrome and it will work.
